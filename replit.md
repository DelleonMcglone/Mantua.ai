# Overview

Mantua Protocol is a modern DeFi (Decentralized Finance) personal assistant application built as a full-stack web application. The platform serves as a user-friendly interface for DeFi operations including hooks, swaps, and programmable liquidity management. The application features a clean, professional design inspired by modern crypto platforms like Uniswap and Aave, with a chat-based interaction model for enhanced user experience.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using **React 18** with **TypeScript** and follows a component-based architecture:

- **Framework**: Vite-powered React application with TypeScript for type safety
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system implementing purple-themed color palette
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Component Structure**: Modular components organized by feature (Header, Sidebar, MainContent, ChatInput, ActionButtons)

The design system follows a cohesive purple color scheme (270Â° 85% 60% primary) with Inter font family and responsive layout patterns.

## Backend Architecture
The backend uses a **Node.js/Express** server architecture:

- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database Integration**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL session store
- **API Structure**: RESTful API design with /api prefix routing
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface supporting both memory and database implementations

## Data Storage Solutions
**Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL for cloud deployment
- **Fallback**: In-memory storage implementation for development/testing

Current schema includes basic user management with username/password authentication.

## Authentication and Authorization
Basic authentication structure is prepared but not fully implemented:
- User schema with username/password fields
- Password hashing and validation ready for implementation
- Session-based authentication using express-session
- Storage abstraction supports user creation and retrieval operations

## Development and Build System
**Build Pipeline**: 
- Vite for frontend bundling with React plugin
- ESBuild for backend compilation
- TypeScript compilation with strict mode enabled
- Path aliases configured for clean imports (@/, @shared/)

**Development Environment**:
- Hot module replacement via Vite
- Concurrent frontend/backend development
- Replit-specific optimizations and error handling
