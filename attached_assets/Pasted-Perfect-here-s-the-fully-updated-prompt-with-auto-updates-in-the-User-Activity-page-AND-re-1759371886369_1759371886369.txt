### üü£ Replit Prompt: **User Activity Page Routing, States, Auto-Updates & Chat Feedback**

Implement the **User Activity page** accessible from the sidebar.

---

**1. Routing**

* When user clicks `User Activity` in the sidebar ‚Üí navigate to `/user-activity`.
* Display the User Activity page.

---

**2. Page Layout**

* Title: `"Your activity"` with back arrow.
* Subtext: `"View your recent transactions and interactions with Mantua protocol."`
* **Portfolio Summary Cards**:

  * Total portfolio value
  * Overall gains/losses
  * Transactions count
* **Portfolio Value Over Time chart** (line/area chart).
* **Recent Activity Table**:

  * Columns: Activity, Assets, Amounts, Value, Date, Status
  * Filters: All | Swaps | Liquidity pools

---

**3. States**

* **Empty State** (no user actions):

  * Portfolio value = `$0.00`
  * Gains/losses = `$0.00`
  * Transactions = `0`
  * Chart flat at 0
  * Empty table
* **Populated State** (after user actions):

  * Fill summary cards with calculated values.
  * Chart updates with historical activity.
  * Table shows transaction history (e.g., ‚ÄúSwap ETH to USDC, 0.2 ETH, $807.89, Completed‚Äù).

---

**4. Auto-Updates**

* When a **Swap** or **Liquidity action** completes:

  * Push a new row into the **Recent Activity table**.
  * Update **Portfolio Summary cards** (total value, gains/losses, transactions count).
  * Update the **Portfolio Value Over Time chart** with the new balance.
* These updates should happen immediately after the action confirmation, no manual refresh required.

---

**5. Chat Feedback (New)**

* When a swap or liquidity action is confirmed ‚Üí also inject a chat message into the chatbot feed:

  * Example:

    * `"Activity updated: Swap ETH ‚Üí USDC added to history"`
    * `"Activity updated: Added liquidity to ETH/USDC pool"`
* Chat message should appear **from the system/assistant role**, styled differently from user messages.
* Clicking on the message should provide a shortcut link to the **User Activity page**.

---

**6. Styling**

* Mantua theme (rounded cards, subtle shadows, purple chart gradient).
* Completed transactions ‚Üí green status pill.
* Failed transactions (if added later) ‚Üí red status pill.

---

‚ö° Do you want me to also extend this so **Agent Activity** in the sidebar works the same way (auto-updates + chat feedback when agents perform actions), or should we keep that separate for now?
