Here’s the **exact one-shot prompt** you can paste into **Replit’s AI (or Cursor)** to automatically fix all merge conflicts in your `MainContent.tsx` file cleanly and restore working Swap behavior:

### 🧩 **Replit One-Shot Prompt: Resolve Merge Conflicts in `MainContent.tsx`**

````
🧠 TASK:
Resolve all merge conflicts and restore a clean, working version of `client/src/components/MainContent.tsx`.

The file currently has Git merge conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) due to conflicting edits between branches. All conflicts must be resolved while preserving full functionality of the Mantua.AI chat interface, Swap, Add Liquidity, and Available Pools flows.

---

🛠️ REQUIREMENTS:
1. Remove all merge conflict markers and duplicate imports.
2. Ensure the file imports and renders the following correctly:
   - `ChatInput` from `./ChatInput`
   - `SwapPage` from `@/pages/Swap`
   - `AddLiquidityPage` from `@/pages/AddLiquidity`
   - `AvailablePoolsPage` from `@/pages/AvailablePools`
   - `AvailablePoolsPrompt` from `@/components/liquidity/AvailablePoolsPrompt`
   - All required hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useCallback`, `useActiveAccount`, `useLocation`, `useChatContext`
   - Utilities: `parseUserCommand`, `HOOKS`, `HOOK_SYNONYMS`, `normalizeHook`, `canonicalizeTokenSymbol`, `extractTokensFromText`, `txUrl`, and `baseSepolia`.

3. Ensure clicking the “+” button → selecting “Swap” renders `<SwapPage />` inside the main area.
4. Ensure Add Liquidity and Available Pools also render correctly.
5. Make sure no undefined imports remain and the file compiles with no TypeScript or lint errors.

---

🧩 FINAL OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:
- Produce a **clean, working, conflict-free** `MainContent.tsx` file.
- Maintain existing Mantua styling and component structure.
- Include the working state handler:

  ```tsx
  const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState<string | null>(null);
````

* Include conditional rendering for:

  ```tsx
  {activeView === "swap" && <SwapPage />}
  {activeView === "add-liquidity" && <AddLiquidityPage />}
  {activeView === "available-pools" && <AvailablePoolsPage />}
  ```

* Preserve the chat interface and ensure it still works when `activeView` is null.

---

💬 END RESULT:
When Replit finishes, `MainContent.tsx` should:

* Build successfully with no merge conflict markers
* Render the correct component when actions are selected
* Allow chat input to function normally
* Contain no syntax, import, or type errors

```

---

✅ **Next step:**  
Copy and paste that entire block into your Replit AI sidebar (or `/fix` command).  
Replit will automatically resolve the conflicts and output a clean, working `MainContent.tsx`.  

Would you like me to add a follow-up prompt that tests `MainContent.tsx` after merge resolution to confirm all components render correctly?
