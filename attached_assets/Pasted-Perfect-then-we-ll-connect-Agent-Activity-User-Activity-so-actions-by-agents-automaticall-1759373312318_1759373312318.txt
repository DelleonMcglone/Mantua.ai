Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî then we‚Äôll **connect Agent Activity + User Activity**, so actions by agents automatically update **both dashboards** (agent view + portfolio view).

Here‚Äôs the **final combined Replit prompt** for you:

---

### üü£ Replit Prompt: **Agent & User Activity Integration with Auto-Updates + Chat Feedback**

---

**1. Routing**

* `User Activity` in sidebar ‚Üí `/user-activity`.
* `Agent Activity` in sidebar ‚Üí `/agent-activity`.
* Each page shows its respective dashboard.

---

**2. User Activity Page**

* Summary cards: Total portfolio value, Gains/Losses, Transactions.
* Portfolio Value Over Time chart.
* Recent Activity Table (All | Swaps | Liquidity pools).
* Auto-updates when user performs swaps/liquidity actions.

---

**3. Agent Activity Page**

* Summary cards: Cumulative returns, Total value managed, Commands processed.
* Portfolio Value Over Time chart.
* Active Agents Table (All | Swaps | Liquidity pools).
* Button: **Pause Agent Activity**.
* Auto-updates when agents perform actions.

---

**4. Integration Between User & Agent Activity**

* When an **agent executes a swap or liquidity action**:

  1. Add entry to **Agent Activity table** (showing strategy, performance, execution time, status).
  2. Also push corresponding entry to **User Activity table** (showing portfolio impact, token movement, value).
  3. Update **both sets of summary cards** (agent metrics + portfolio metrics).
  4. Update **both charts** with new balance/returns.

Example:

* Agent executes ‚Üí `Swap 0.5 ETH ‚Üí USDC`.
* **Agent Activity** logs: `"Swap 0.5 ETH for USDC | $807.89 | 2.6s | Completed"`.
* **User Activity** logs: `"Swap 0.5 ETH for USDC | $807.89 | Completed"`.
* Portfolio and managed value both increment.

---

**5. Chat Feedback**

* On every swap/liquidity action (manual or agent-driven), insert a chat message:

  * User action: `"Activity updated: Swap ETH ‚Üí USDC added to history"`
  * Agent action: `"Agent executed: Swap 0.5 ETH ‚Üí USDC (Completed)"`
* Each message should include a **link/shortcut** to the relevant page:

  * `"View in User Activity"`
  * `"View in Agent Activity"`

---

**6. Styling**

* Mantua theme (rounded cards, purple accents, gradient charts).
* Status pills:

  * Green = Completed
  * Yellow = Pending
  * Red = Failed
* Real-time updates, no manual refresh.

---

‚ö° This way, **User Activity = portfolio impact** and **Agent Activity = agent performance**, but both stay in sync.

Do you also want me to add a **‚ÄúUnified Activity Feed‚Äù in the sidebar** (merging both, with filters: All | User | Agents), or should we keep them separate for now?
