**About Mantua.AI Content:**

```
Mantua.AI is the programmable liquidity layer for DeFi.
It combines AI reasoning, Uniswap v4 hooks, and onchain agents to give you natural-language control over liquidity.

Here are some example actions you can perform with Mantua:

Swap
Execute swaps with or without hooks.
- Swap ETH for USDC using a dynamic fee hook
- Swap ETH for cbBTC (standard swap, no hook)

Deploy
Spin up hooks and agents directly from chat.
- Create a new Uniswap v4 pool with a custom dynamic fee hook
- Launch an agent that can:
  ‚Ä¢ Request testnet funds via faucet
  ‚Ä¢ Manage wallet details and balance checks
  ‚Ä¢ Execute trades

Understand
Analyze contracts, pools, and hooks.
- What hooks are active in the ETH/USDC pool on Base?
- What ERC standards does contract 0x5932...627f implement?
- Show me the total liquidity in my deployed pool

Interact
Query balances and wallet info.
- How much ETH is in my wallet?
- What is the current value of my LP position in the ETH/USDC pool?

Explore
Access blockchain-level data and activity.
- What's the current gas price on Base?
- Show the last 10 transactions for my wallet
- Get details for transaction 0xdfc4...9e04

Research
Retrieve token, protocol, and market insights.
- What's the market price of ETH on Base?
- Compare TVL between ETH/USDC pools on Base vs Unichain
- Show me recent volume trends for cbBTC on Base

Hooks are custom pieces of logic that extend Uniswap v4 pools and in some cases swaps.
They let developers and traders add intelligence, protection, and new features directly into liquidity.

Examples of hooks:
- Dynamic Fee Hook: Adjust fees automatically based on volatility.
- TWAP Hook: Smooth execution using time-weighted averages.
- MEV Protection Hook: Add protection against front-running.
- Custom Hooks: Deploy custom logic (whitelists, rewards, splits).
- Pool-Level Insights: Track LP activity and execution behavior.

* **+ button** shows only the four reordered items.

‚ö° Do you want the **About page content** to render as a **scrollable markdown-style page** (with sections, bold headers, and bullet points), or as a **chat message-style card** inside the app?
