Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî I see your **Agent Activity page** with both empty state and populated state. This should mirror the **User Activity flow** but focused on AI Agents.

Here‚Äôs the **Replit prompt** to implement it cleanly:

---

### üü£ Replit Prompt: **Agent Activity Page Routing, States, Auto-Updates & Chat Feedback**

Implement the **Agent Activity page** accessible from the sidebar.

---

**1. Routing**

* When user clicks `Agent Activity` in the sidebar ‚Üí navigate to `/agent-activity`.
* Display the Agent Activity page.

---

**2. Page Layout**

* Title: `"Agent activity"` with back arrow.
* Subtext: `"Monitor and manage your AI agents‚Äô performance and actions."`
* **Summary Cards**:

  * Cumulative returns (e.g., 15.2%)
  * Total value managed
  * Commands processed / Transactions count
* **Portfolio Value Over Time chart** (line/area chart).
* **Active Agents Table**:

  * Columns: Activity, Value, Date, Performance, Status
  * Filters: All | Swaps | Liquidity pools
* **Controls**:

  * Button to **Pause agent activity** (bottom of page).

---

**3. States**

* **Empty State** (no agent activity):

  * All values = `$0.00` or `0`
  * Chart flat at 0
  * Empty agents table
* **Populated State** (agents running actions):

  * Show real values in summary cards.
  * Chart updates with historical managed value.
  * Active Agents table filled with transactions (e.g., ‚ÄúSwap 0.5 ETH for USDC‚Äù).
  * Status badges:

    * Green = Completed
    * Yellow = Pending
    * Red = Failed

---

**4. Auto-Updates**

* When an **agent executes a swap or liquidity action**:

  * Add a new row to the **Active Agents table**.
  * Update **Cumulative returns**, **Total value managed**, and **Commands processed** cards.
  * Update the **Portfolio Value Over Time chart** with new balance.
* These updates should be real-time (immediately after agent confirmation).

---

**5. Chat Feedback**

* Whenever an agent performs an action, also inject a message into the chatbot feed:

  * Example:

    * `"Agent executed: Swap 0.5 ETH ‚Üí USDC (Completed)"`
    * `"Agent pending: Added liquidity to ETH/USDC pool"`
* These chat messages should be styled as **system/assistant messages**, not user input.
* Include a **link/shortcut to Agent Activity page** in each message.

---

**6. Styling**

* Mantua theme (rounded cards, purple accents, subtle shadows).
* Portfolio chart styled with gradient fill.
* Status pills: Completed (green), Pending (yellow), Failed (red).
* ‚ÄúPause Agent Activity‚Äù button = red outline, positioned at bottom.

---

‚ö° Do you want me to also **connect Agent Activity with User Activity**, so whenever an agent performs a swap it shows up **in both pages** (Agent = who did it, User = portfolio impact)?
