Here’s your **ready-to-use Replit prompt** — clean, specific, and formatted for your AI coding agent or Cursor/Claude/Code Interpreter to execute without confusion 👇

---

### 🧠 **Prompt for Replit / Cursor**

> **Task:**
> Update the **Swap Component** (in the Mantua app) to match the new 3-step swap flow and UI layout shown in the 3 screenshots (`Swap1.png`, `Swap2.png`, `Swap3.png`).

---

### 🪄 **Requirements**

1. **UI Enhancements**

   * When the user enters a **Sell amount**, display the **USD equivalent** directly below both the **Sell** and **Buy** fields.
   * Use a placeholder for the real-time token price until APIs are added.
     *(Later, we’ll integrate CoinGecko’s free API for live pricing.)*

2. **Button Flow Logic**

   * The main button at the bottom should change states as follows:

     * Default: **`Swap`**
     * After click or command “swap”: change to **`Review`**
     * After click or command “review”: show expanded review details
     * After click or command “review approved”: change to **`Approve and Swap`**
     * Clicking **Approve and Swap** executes the transaction.

3. **Review Details Section**
   When “Review” is triggered, show a summary (as in screenshots) including:

   * Amount of ETH equivalent to the sell amount
   * **Fee (0.25%)**
   * **Hook Fee** *(new line, placeholder value for now)*
   * **Network cost**
   * **Order routing**
   * **Price impact**
   * **Maximum slippage**
   * Keep styling consistent with Uniswap’s dark UI and use Mantua’s pink accent for the primary button.

4. **Mantua Intel Hook**

   * Add a **new hook option** called `Mantua Intel (Hook)` right after `No Hook` in the hook dropdown.
   * Mantua Intel acts as a “no-op” hook (no logic change yet, placeholder for now).
   * Under Fee, show:
     `Hook Fee: $0.00`
     `Order routing: Mantua Intel (Hook)`

5. **Swap Review State Examples**

   * “Swap” → user clicks → changes to **Review**
   * “Review” → shows expanded breakdown like the second screenshot
   * “Approve and Swap” → executes transaction and confirms swap, as in third screenshot

6. **APIs**

   * No live APIs yet — use placeholder USD values.
     Example: `"$2.38"` for Sell and `"$2.36"` for Buy.
   * Later integration will use CoinGecko’s `/simple/price` endpoint.

7. **Files to Update**

   * `/client/src/components/Swap.tsx`
   * `/client/src/components/hooksList.ts` (if hooks are defined separately)

---

### ✅ **Expected Behavior**

* Enter sell amount → shows USD equivalents.
* Click “Swap” → changes to “Review”.
* Click or type “Review” → expanded summary with all trade details.
* Click or type “Review Approved” → button changes to “Approve and Swap”.
* Click “Approve and Swap” → executes transaction.
* Mantua Intel Hook selectable, labeled and styled consistently.

---

### 📁 **Screenshots Reference**

Attach:

* `Swap1.png` — Swap input screen
* `Swap2.png` — Review screen
* `Swap3.png` — Approve and Swap confirmation screen

---

Would you like me to **add an implementation-ready Swap.tsx scaffold** that includes these states (Swap → Review → Approve) with Mantua Intel prewired as the first hook? It’ll be plug-and-play for Replit.
